After Clicking "Add Mod's" or "Remove Mod's", you will be promted with a filedialog system.

Click the "Browse..." button, it will prompt you into steams native "!Workshop"
folder. When you find your desired mod, simply click the mod folder, then press "Okay", 
This will add it to a list of mods to be copied into your server folder.

When you have selected all the mods you would like to load, simply close the FileDialog 
System then mods will load automatically. It works the same for removing mods, the only 
difference is that you must back out of the mods folder into your server folder.
